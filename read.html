            <p>Many, many, many years ago. Before I was even a baby owl an event was forged deep in the Meadowland forest. A competition, three months out of the year, among all the tribes.</p>

            <p class="character">WANDA (V.O.)</p>
            <p>Each tribe sent two athletes to compete in a grueling battle of strength, courage, and wit. The winning athlete would claim the rich plots of Meadowland while the lesser tribes were banished to the Empty Lands until next year.</p>

            <p>The concept was simple, the stakes were high. For twenty years one tribe dominated the competition, they had the strongest athlete the Games had ever seen. Some tribes didn't dare enter an athlete out of fear of injury or... worse.</p>
